A plugin that contains blocks for the Bootstrap theme that help you customize your site in your style. All blocks are based on Bootstrap CSS.

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin that contains many blocks to build your Bootstrap Basic FSE theme, or you can use it with any Bootstrap 5 themes.

You can manually set CSS class(es) by referring to the Bootstrap document.

Supported custom HTML attributes like `data-*`, `aria-*` in most blocks.

Available blocks:

* Customizable div
* Layout container
* Layout row
* Layout column
* Search (for navbar and anywhere else)
* Pagination (for list posts)
* Navbar container
* Navbar toggler button (for responsive toggler)
* Navbar responsive wrapper (collapse, offcanvas)
* Navbar navigation (display menu items)
* Button (link, or button)
* Comment form
* Post navigation (display next, previous post)

Tested up to PHP 8.5.

The original source code is on GitHub ( https://github.com/Rundiz-WP/rundizstrap-companion ). 
It contains the original source of blocks before compile/build and blocks that are already built, the build tools via Node package (package.json).
